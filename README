Sample code for testing out Akka Java API.

1. Project structure and compile

    There are 3 projects in the repository:

    * AkkawebDemo1.0    : this is the 'server' project, where remote typed and untyped actors run.
    * AkkawebDemoClient : 'client' project, where client actors are executed. Client actors normally invoke remote actors deployed in the server.
    * common            : shared code.

    To compile and run the code you need to install Gradle 0.9-rc1 (http://www.gradle.org/) 
    Steps:
    - Download and unzip Gradle (http://dist.codehaus.org/gradle/gradle-0.9-rc-1-all.zip)
    - Follow installation instruction here: http://www.gradle.org/installation.html

    After Gradle installation, run 'gradle clean build' in the project root folder.

2. Generate Intellij Idea project file

    run 'gradle idea' in one of the 3 project folders. The task will generate the .iml project file with all the dependencies set.
    Open Idea, File --> New Module --> Import Existing Module --> Select .iml file
